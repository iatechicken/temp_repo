Now, this is scripture.  By your definition, \nthis is truth and therefore absolute.  \n\nDo women in your church speak?  Do they cover their heads?  If all \nscripture is absolute truth, it seems to me that women speaking in and \ncoming to church with bare heads should be intolerable to evangelicals.  \nYet, clearly, women do speak in evangelical churches and come with bare \nheads.  (At least this was the case in the evangelical churches I grew \nup in.)\n\nEvangelicals are clearly not taking this particular part of scripture \nto be absolute truth.  (And there are plenty of other examples.)\nCan you reconcile this?\n\n> Many people claim that there are no absolutes in the world.  Such a\n> statement is terribly self-contradictory.

The Shephard's Rod (now \ndefunct as far as I know)broke off from the SDA Church in the 30's.\n\nThe Shephard's Rod broke away from the SDA Church because they felt that the \nSDA Church was becoming weak and falling into apostacy.  They felt that they \nwere the remnant spoken about in Revelation.\n\nAbout the Koresh group, Koresh gained control of it in 1987 or 1988.  Once \nin control, he made himself the center of it. He proclaimed himself as \nChrist.\n\nKoresh himself came from an SDA background. He was excommunicated as a young \nadult by the local congregation for trying to exert too much control over \nthe youth in the church.  After this, he joined the Branch Davidians.\n\nThey were/are a survivalist cult. This is why they had the stockpile of \nweapons, food, a bomb shelter, etc.  They had no intent of raiding the US \ngovernment or anything. They were preparing for Armaggedon and were \nputting themselves in a self defense position.  \n\nIn my opinion, if the ATF and the FBI had left well enough alone, we wouldn'\nt have the blood of 20+ children crying out from the ashes in Waco.\n\nIf you want to know about The Shephard's Rod, you might want to visit the \nlocal SDA church and talk to some of the older people.  They could give you \nsome insight into where Koresh got his theology.\n\nTammy",

I don't know if this is\nbelieveing blindly or not. I'm not sure how blindness comes into it. I do\nnot deny reason, indeed I insist upon it, but reason only draws conclusions\nfrom evidence. If you decide in advance that your reason will act only on\nthe evidence of the five physical senses, then you cut reason off from any\npossibility of reaching a conclusion outside the physical sphere (beyond the\nrather provocative, if inconclusive, conclusion that the physical sphere\nis not self explanatory). \n\nChristians claim that they have received a different kind of evidence, \nwhich they call faith, and which is a gift of God. That is, this evidence\nis the evidence of a thing which chooses to reveal or hide itself. The \nevidence of the senses cannot tell you is such a ting exists. Reasoning\non the evidence of the senses won't help either. But Christians do reason\nof the evidence of faith, and do claim that this evidence is wholly\nconsistent with the evidence of the other senses, and indeed, that the\nevidence of these other senses is part of God's revelation of himself\nto us.\n\nIt is not necessarilly the case however that knowledge of a God must come\nthrough this route. There may be other senses than the physical ones\nproviding evidence of non-physical realities. (There may, of course, be\nphysical realities of a type for which we have no corresponding senses, for\nall we know.) These senses, if they exist, may provide valid evidence for\nreason to work on. And, as with all senses, these senses may be impaired\nin some people, that is, they may be spiritually blind. In this sense,\nbelief in God becomes an act of sight, and it is disbelief which is blind.\n\n>You are right that science and reason cannot PROVE anything.

It is clear that human beings\nhave many systems for explaining the evidence of the physical senses, and\nsimilarly there are many systems for explaining the evidence provided by\nfaith. Religious believers in general, and Christians in particular, use\nreason to help sift through the evidence to come to a clearer understanding\nof the evidence provided by faith. Science claims, with good reason, to be\nthe most valid system for explaining the physical universe, and Christianity\nclaims, also with good reason, to be the most valid system, possessed of the\nbest evidence, for explaining Gods revelations of himself to man.\n\nIf you doubt that Christians use reason, read this newsgroup for a while\nand you will see rational debate aplenty.\n-- \n==============================================================================\nMark Baker                  | \"The task ... is not to cut down jungles, but \naa888@Freenet.carleton.ca   | to irrigate deserts.\" -- C.

Why is this so?\n\n\tFurther, it appears that only humans have a \"need\" to explain the\n\tunexplained.  Why is this so?  The other animals on this planet,\n\tincluding those with advanced mental facilities, seem perfectly\n\tcontent in their ignorance.\n\n\tI'd like to point out that your presuppositions scream out at me\n\tfrom your unsupported statement.  They are: 1) humans are animal\n\t*only*; 2) religion exists as a crutch so that the unexplained need\n\tnot be researched; 3) religion was \"made up\" by humans to address a\n\tperceived need; 4) the biological aspect of humans is deified (that\n\tis, all aspects of human life can be categorized in a hierarchical\n\tstructure with biology at the apex).\n\n\tNeedless to say, I disagree with your strong opinion #1 and the\n\tunderlying presuppositions.\n\n>Christianity is an infectious cult.

It has\n\tcertainly shown itself to be persistent as a belief system, in\n\tspite of various persecutions throughout the past two millenia.\n\tThat it continues to persevere does not demonstrate that it is\n\t\"infectious\" in a derrogatory sense; it may be that it provides\n\ta workable system for its adherents (and I would argue that this\n\tis the case).\n\n\tI disagree that Christianity is \"a safety blanket\" which supplants\n\thope and purpose.  Rather, it points an individual to the one\n\tSource of hope and purpose.  There is nothing hidden about a\n\tChristian's source for hope and purpose.  Of what usefulness to\n\tyou is the distinction between internally motivated hope and purpose\n\tand externally given hope and purpose?  Is the (apparent) loss of\n\tcontrol over one's own life the problem or is it something else?\n\n\tFinally, one does not appropriate \"eternal happiness\" by following\n\tChristian moral standards.  Indeed, the sole reason for the existance\n\tof Christianity is *because* standards are inadequate to save people\n\tfrom their imperfections.  Moral standards are merely guides to the\n\tChristian; the real power to moral living is given to the Christian\n\tin the Person of God's Spirit.\n\n\tHeaven is one of two final states that\n\tChristian doctrine postulates.  However, Christians are generally\n\tnot motivated to live according to Christian moral standards by this\n\tpromised future reward; rather, they are motivated by the perceived\n\tbenefits to them in the here-and-now.\n\n>but i digress...

A best friend of mine breifly entered a christian\n>group and within months, they set ministry guidelines for him which\n>basicaly said this -->Priority #1 Spread the Word.\n\n\tMany Christian organizations are concerned with evangelism as a\n\tpriority, and rightly so (for it was Jesus Himself who gave this\n\tas a priority for His followers).  However, it is not the penultimate\n\tpriority as evangelism is normally understood (i.e. preach the word,\n\tconvert at nearly any cost, repeat with new convert ad infinitum).\n\tRather, such evangelism is generally best done through respecting\n\tthe opinions of others while *demonstrating* the very real benefits\n\tof a Christian lifestyle.  This demonstration should be so powerful\n\tthat it compels the non-Christian to seek out the Christian to ask\n\t\"Why?\"  Needless to say, such a demonstration is not easily accom-\n\tplished (it takes a radical committment to the person of Jesus), it\n\tdoes not happen quickly (so perseverance on the part of the Christian\n\tis required), and it cannot occur where no personal bonds of\n\tfriendship exist (it is ineffective with strangers who cannot\n\tevaluate the demonstration over time, and it is easy to alienate or\n\tharm others if the sole purpose of being a \"friend\" is to gain a\n\tconversion).\n\n\tAs a long-time Christian (nearly 20 years), I view with some skep-\n\tticism *all* evangelism programs which incorporate a \"hurry-up\"\n\tattitude.  Pressured conversions may ultimately be worse than no\n\tconversion at all (because the pressured convert realizes s/he was\n\tcoerced and disavows Christianity when they would have been open\n\tto it in the future had they not been taken advantage of now).\n\tThe Bible states that it is the very Spirit of God which brings\n\tconviction of wrong-doing to people.  I am content to do my part\n\t(witness) and let the Spirit do the rest.\n\n>We are _just_ animals.  We need sleep, food, and we reproduce.  And we\n>die.      \n\n\tWe are far more than animals.  We sleep, eat, reproduce, and die\n\tjust as other animals do - true.  But, we are also capable of more\n\tthan this.  If your personal vision of humanity (or of yourself) is\n\tso limited, I can only hope and pray ;-) that you will someday find\n\ta more expansive view.\n\n\t(For reflection, what animals have the wide variety of performing\n\tarts that humans do?  How is it that humans can learn the language\n\tof other humans (or animals) but that other animals cannot do so?\n\tHow is it that humans can organize themselves in various social\n\tstructures whereas other animals have only one structure?)\n\n>Religion (especially Christianity) is nothing more than a DRUG.\n\n\tBlatant assertion.  Christianity is not physically addictive.\n\tChristianity is not psychologically addictive.  Christianity is not\n\ta *thing* which one snorts/ingests/shoots-up; it is a relationship\n\twith a living being.

Although one definition of 'curse'\nis 'retribution', I only meant 'harm or misfortune' when I used the\nword.  Because God loves us he has told us the best way to live in his\nBible.

Whether they got the disease through\n>their own actions or not is irrelevant.  They still need Jesus...\n\nThe first issue you bring up is your anger.  It is \"obvious\"ly wrong to\nbe angry (Gal 5:19-20) for any reason, especially *extremely* angry\nwhich is on par with hatred.  Jesus has every reason to be angry at us\nfor putting him on the cross with our sin, yet his prayer was \"forgive\nthem Father, they know not what they do.\"  Knowing how forgiving Jesus\nhas been with me calls me to be more forgiving with everyone out of\nlove for Him.  Please don't give in to anger, it will only cause\nfoolish quarrels and more bad feelings.\n\nIt's okay if you read something that bothers you, but you need to\naddress it in a loving way.  If right now, I felt like someone out\nthere was saying that God punishes gay or sexually immoral people with\nAIDS because they deserve punishment that others don't then I would\nframe a response something like this:\n\n\"It makes me feel very sad for someone to believe that AIDS, which is\nsimply a harmful disease not so unlike any other, is God's punishment\nfor people who have committed certain sins.  God loves all of his\nchildren equally and rejoices when a single one comes back to him.  We\nwill all be judged after we die, but until then we all have the\nopportunity to accept God's grace by earnestly seeking after him with\nall of our hearts, believing the gospel's testimony, repenting of our\nsin, confessing that Jesus is Lord at baptism, and living a new life\nfor him.\n Let us not judge someone to be eternally condemned.  God's arm is not\nto short to save.  He will do anything he can to move a hardened heart\nor a misled person.  He works for the good of all men.  Even through\nthe worst of situations, he has set the times and places for all men\nthat they may perhaps reach out and find him.\"\n\nThe second issue you bring up is seeing people rationalize their fears\nof people with AIDS.  Fortunately, what you describe as seeing is\nactually misperceiving.  You have been missing the points made in the\nearlier posts and reacting in anger to attitudes that haven't been\nexpressed.  I know that its sometimes hard to discount your\nperceptions, but please try to be open-minded.\n\nYou are quite correct in saying that we should reach out to all people\nbecause they all need Jesus.  This is what my brothers and sisters and\nI do on a daily basis.  If you would like to send me the name of the\ncity and state you live in, I will find and get you in touch with some\nbrothers who have AIDS or know people with AIDS and live nearby you so\nthat you can see the loving attitudes for yourself.\n\nThe third issue you bring up is the importance of how some individual\ncontracted AIDS.  How someone gets AIDS is only relevant to their\nsalvation in that there may be repetence involved.\n\nThe important point to be made, however, is that not listening to God's\ncommands (or advice or warnings), i.e. sinning, causes harm or\nmisfortune to yourself and others.  For this reason, a good way to\nprevent the misfortune of AIDS, which can be transmitted in sinful ways,\nis to listen to God's advice and have sex only with your wife or\nhusband.\n\nI hope that you are feeling better now, Paul.\n\nLove,\n\nAaron Cardenas",

Well, let me just say that the reason for this\nwas ....)\n   don't accuse each other (It was your fault that ... happened!)\n   find a common ground about SOMETHING (Lampshades really are\ndecorational and functional at the same time.)\n   Guaranteed, in a situation like this, there is going to be some\ngunnysacking (re-hashing topics which were assumed resolved, but were\ntruly not and someone feels someone else is to blame).  However, this\nshould be kept to a minimum and simply ask for forgiveness or apologize\nabout each situation WITHOUT holding a smoldering grudge.  \n\nThe relationship really can work.  It's just a matter of keeping things\nsmooth and even.  It's sort of like making a peace treaty between\nwarring factions:  you can't give one side everything; there must be a\ncompromise.  Breaks can be taken, but communication between everyone\ninvolved must continue if the relationships here are to survive.\n\nJoe Fisher",

When science\ndiscovered the process of conception, the next step was to assume that\nMary was conceived without original sin, the Immaculate Conception.\n\nMary at that time appeared to a girl named Bernadette at Lourdes.  She \nrefered to herself as the Immaculate Conception.  Since a nine year old \nwould have no way of knowing about the doctrine, the apparition was deemed\nto be true and it sealed the case for the doctrine.\n\nRCs hold that all revelation comes from two equally important sources, that\nbeing Sacred Scripture and Holy Tradition.

It's a very biblical doctrine as\nRomans 8.28-30 shows (among other passages).  Furthermore, the Church\nhas always taught predestination, from the very beginning.  But to say\nthat I believe in Predestination does not mean I do not believe in free\nwill.  Men freely choose the course of their life, which is also\naffected by the grace of God.  However, unlike the Calvinists and\nJansenists, I hold that grace is resistable, otherwise you end up with\nthe idiocy of denying the universal saving will of God (1 Timothy 2.4). \nFor God must give enough grace to all to be saved.  But only the elect,\nwho he foreknew, are predestined and receive the grace of final\nperserverance, which guarantees heaven.  This does not mean that those\nwithout that grace can't be saved, it just means that god foreknew their\nobstinacy and chose not to give it to them, knowing they would not need\nit, as they had freely chosen hell.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  ^^^^^^^^^^^\nPeople who are saved are saved by the grace of God, and not by their own\neffort, for it was God who disposed them to Himself, and predestined\nthem to become saints.  But those who perish in everlasting fire perish\nbecause they hardened their heart and chose to perish.  Thus, they were\ndeserving of God;s punishment, as they had rejected their Creator, and\nsinned against the working of the Holy Spirit.\n\n>yes, it is up to God to judge.  but he will only mete out that\n>punishment at the last judgement. \n\nWell, I would hold that as God most certainly gives everybody some\nblessing for what good they have done (even if it was only a little),\nfor those He can't bless in the next life, He blesses in this one.  And\nthose He will not punish in the next life, will be chastised in this one\nor in Purgatory for their sins.  Every sin incurs some temporal\npunishment, thus, God will punish it unless satisfaction is made for it\n(cf. 2 Samuel 12.13-14, David's sin of Adultery and Murder were\nforgiven, but he was still punished with the death of his child.)  And I\nneed not point out the idea of punishment because of God's judgement is\nquite prevelant in the Bible.  Sodom and Gommorrah, Moses barred from\nthe Holy Land, the slaughter of the Cannanites, Annias and Saphira,\nJerusalem in 70 AD, etc.\n\n> if jesus stopped the stoning of an adulterous woman (perhaps this is\nnot a >good parallel, but i'm going to go with it anyway), why should we\nnot >stop the murder and violation of people who may (or may not) be more\n>innocent?\n\nWe should stop the slaughter of the innocent (cf Proverbs 24.11-12), but\ndoes that mean that Christians should support a war in Bosnia with the\nU.S. or even the U.N. involved?  I do not think so, but I am an\nisolationist, and disagree with foreign adventures in general.  But in\nthe case of Bosnia, I frankly see no excuse for us getting militarily\ninvolved, it would not be a \"just war.\"  \"Blessed\" after all, \"are the\npeacemakers\" was what Our Lord said, not the interventionists.  Our\nactions in Bosnia must be for peace, and not for a war which is\nunrelated to anything to justify it for us.\n\nAndy Byler",

The concept of a closed canon would\n>certainly cast a shadow on contemporary prophets.  On the other hand,\n>an open canon seems to be indicated sometimes.\n\nThere are a lot of people running around saying \"God told me this\" and \n\"God told me that\" these days.  Some people really have heard God, and others\nheard their glands.  Mario Murrillo mentioned this in a sermon once.  He\nsaid someone told him, \"The Lord gave me a song.\"  He said that it was\nthe worst song he had ever heard.\n\n\"I know why he gave you that song,\" Murillo said, \"He didn't want it anymore.\"\n\nBut God does still speak to His people today, and the idea is contrary to the\nidea of a closed cannon.  Ireneaus wrote about all the gifts of the Spirit\nin the church of His day (2nd and 3rd century) and he was one of the first\nto put forth a New Testament cannon, which was almost identical to the one\nwe have today.  He believed in a closed cannon.  \n\nMany prophets prophesied prophecies which were not recorded in the Scriptures.\nFor example, one prophet in Kings, whose name starts with an \"M\" who\nprophecied that the king would lose a battle.  That is the only prophecy\nhe gave recorded in Scripture, and we no that he had given other prophecies\nbecause the king complained before he heard the prophecy, \"He never prophesies\nanything good about me.\"  Yet only one little paragraph of all of his \nlifetime of prophecies are recorded in Scripture.  There are numerous examples.\nBarnabas was a prophet, Acts says, before he was even sent out as an \napostle.  Yet his writings are not recorded in Scripture.  Only two of\nAgabus prophecies are mentioned in Scripture.  He was already a prophet\nbefore he gave them.  \n\nSo prophecy may be genuine and from God, but that does not make it \nScripture.  \n\n>Also interesting to note is that some so called prophecies are nothing new\n>but rather an inspired translation of scripture.  Is it right to call\n>that prophecy?  Misleading?  Wouldn't that be more having to do with\n>knowledge?\n\nI don't know about translations of Scripture, but I am familiar with \nprophecies that give applications for Scripture.  There are also \nsimilar examples in the Bible.  Several times Peter interprets prophecies\nin a seemingly prophetic way, for example, \"And his bishoprick let another\ntake\" concerning Judas office.\n\nA clearer example can be found in Matthew 24.  Jesus is prophesying about\nwhat will happen before His return and He quotes a passage out of Joel\nabout the sun being darkened and the moon turning to blood.  So Scriptural\nprophecy can be used in later prophecy.  \n\nSometimes this sort of thing can cross over into being a word of knowledge,\nbut gifts of the Spirit seem to overlap.  Words of knowledge and wisdom\ncan overlap.  The word of knowledge and prophecy can overlap.  \nInterpretation of tounges is very similar to prophecy.  Healings are often\nconsidered miracles.  So sometimes the distinction between gifts is a \nbit hazy.  Imho, it doesn't usually matter that much if we are able to\nlabel a phenomenon, as long as we recognize them as the work of the \nSpirit, and use them according to His leading.\n\nLink Hudson.",

She made a\n>specific point to say that it was not that she had never met a good man,\n>since she was married to a wonderful man for a dozen years.  (Take a few\n>seconds and honestly ponder that thought and it's implications!!!)\n\nI have thought about the implications, and it is scary.  \n\nWe have a whole generation of families broken up because some men have \ndecided that is is okay to leave their wives and children for the\nthrill of a younger, more attractive woman.  If we accept that it is\nlegitimate for Jane to have divorced, how can we not accept anyone's\ndecision to divorce because he has found someone with whom he can\nhave a more \"deep, committed relationship.\"\n\nMarriage is not a state of being, it is a mutual journey in life.\nLove is not a passive feeling, it must be actively willed.\n\nIs it acceptable for an older executive to dump his wife of many \nyears who stayed home to care for the children because he\ncan't be happy sexually unless he is with a beautiful\nyoung blonde?  The real solution for both in the couple to\nmake a renewed effort.  \n\nHold fast to the faith.  Has not the Lord repeatedly compared His\nrelation to His people as a faithful and enduring husband?  We\nlearn something very deep and very mystical when we marry and\nremain faithful through times of trial.\n\nMy spouse has a brain tumor that has left her partially paralyzed.\nIf it were to resume growing (it is in remission, thanks be to God!)\nthen perhaps the time would come when we could not have sexual\nrelations.  That's life...the Lord would certainly not give me\npermission to seek someone else to satisfy my \"needs.\"  \n\nThe idea that it is alright to divorce if a couple \"grows apart\"\nseems to me to lead to such a monstrous destruction of the meaning\nof marriage that I feel we must make every effort to avoid any hint\nof compromise.  We have become so petty and small-minded that\nsome husbands are threatening to divorce their wives unless the\nwives lose weight!\n\nI praise the Lord for guiding me to marry my wife.  She married me\nanyway despite the possibility that I could have a terrible illness.\nAnd it turned out that she was the one with the brain tumor, but\nhad I known I wouldn't have cared either.

But assuming that the Pope has universal jurisdiction\nand authority, what authority do you rely upon for your decisions?\nWhat prevents me from choosing ANY doctrine I like and saying that\nPapal disagreement is an error that will be resolved in time?\nThis is especially true, since Councils of Bishops have basically\nstood by the Pope.\n\nIt appears that much of what lies at the heart of this matter is\ndisagreements over what is tradition and Tradition, and also over\nauthority and discipline.  \n\nMy question to the supporters of SSPX is this:\n\n  Is there ANY way that your positions with respect to church reforms\n  could change and be conformed to those of the Pope? (assuming that\n  the Pope's position does not change and that the leaders of SSPX\n  don't jointly make such  choice.)\n\nIf not, this appears to be claiming infallible teaching authority.\nIf I adopt the view that \"I'm NOT wrong, I CAN'T be wrong, and\nthere's NO WAY I'll change my mind, YOU must change yours\", that\nI've either left the Catholic Church or it has left me.\n\nThe Orthodox Church does not recognize papal authority/jurisdiction\nviewing authority as present in each bishop, and in Ecumenical\nCouncils.  We regard the subsequent development of the doctrines \nregarding papal authority and jurisdiction to be a separation of\nthe Bishop of Rome from the Orthodox church.  Without going into\nthe merits of the Great Schism, at least the Orthodox agree that\na split occurred, and don't paly what appear to be semantic games\nlike \"He's the Pope, but we don't recognize that what he does\nis effective...\".  Words aside, it appears to be a de facto split.\n\n>So where are we?  Are we in another Arian heresy, complete with weak\n>Popes?  Or are the SSPX priests modern Martin Luthers?

Would it be honored?  If not, how\ndo you get around the formal doctrine of infallibility?\nAgain, I'm not trying to be contentions, I'm trying to understand.\nSince I'm Orthodox, I've got no real vested interest in the outcome,\none way or the other.\n\n>Schism is a superset of disobedience (refusal to obey a legitimate\n>command).

I know\n>that romans talks about how we are saved by our faith not our deeds, yet\n>hebrews and james say that faith without deeds is useless, saying' You fools,\n>do you still think that just believing is enough?'\n\nActually I don't think there is any conflict if we really understand\nwhat these passages say.  First, what is faith?  If you study the \nmeaning of the Greek and Hebrew words so translated I think you will\ncome to the conclusion that the word means a *lot* more than mere \nbelief.  Faith means both trust and action.  If you do not put your \nbelief into action it simply cannot qualify as faith.  I think this \nis what James means when he says that \"faith without works is dead\" \nand, \"I will show you my faith by my works.\"  Remember James was \nwriting to \"the twelve tribes which are scattered abroad.\"  This \nprobably means he was writing to those who would hear the gospel much \nlater and wouldn't understand the meaning of the original Greek.\n(Indeed I suspect James was writing to us, today, among others he\nintended to reach.)  Paul, on the other hand wrote mostly to the\npeople of the Roman empire who generally understood the meaning of\nthe Greek.\n\nAnother key to why there is no conflict is to look at Paul's\nstatements in their context.  I think you will find that when Paul\ncontrasts faith and works it is in the context of comparing the\ngospel with the Law, meaning the Law of Moses.  This was the great\nburden of Paul's life.  As the apostle to the Gentiles he would go\nconvert a bunch of people, then the \"Judizers\" would come along and\ntry to convince them that they also had to obey the Law of Moses (cf\nActs chapter 15).  In this context Paul condemns the idea of being\nsaved by the works of the Law, saying that we are saved by the blood\nof Jesus and our faith in him.  I believe that a better translation\nfor today would be that we are saved by *faithfulness*.  I think\n\"faithfulness\" today has a meaning closer to what the original\nwriters intended.\n\n>Now if someone is fully believing but there life is totally lead by themselves\n>and not by God, according to Romans that person is still saved by there faith.\n\nI think you misunderstand Romans.  What Paul is really saying is\nthat God prefers a faithful Gentile who does not \"keep kosher\" to a\nkosher Jew who fails to stay faithful in the more important matters\nof following the Lord and having charity toward his fellows.\n\n>But then there is the bit which says that God preferes someone who is cold to\n>him (i.e. doesn't know him - condemned) so a lukewarm Christian someone who\n>knows and believes in God but doesn't make any attempt to live by the bible.\n\nIn the sense of faith described above, you cannot have real faith and \nbe lukewarm.  If you know God but are lukewarm (unfaithful), you are \nworse off than the person who never heard of Him.  Remember, Jesus in\nthe parable of the pearl of great price (Mat 13:45-46) and again in\nthe one on the treasure hidden in the field (Mat 13:44) indicates that\nthe price of the Kingdom of God is *all* we have.\n\n[I agree with you in general, including the fact that \"pistis\" has\nsome of the force of \"faithful\".  However if you take that too far,\nyou can end up with something that Paul definitely would not have\nintended.  Being faithful means following God in all things.  To say\nthat we are saved by being faithful is very close to saying that we\nare saved by commiting no sins.  I assume that's not what you meant.\n\nI have almost given up on finding a specific verbal formula that\ncompletely captures this.  However I think Paul is describing what I'd\ncall a basic orientation, including aspects such as trust and\ncommitment.  Jesus speaks of it as rebirth, which implies a basic\nchange.  We may still do things that are sinful, and may fail to show\nthe new life in Christ in many situations where we should.  But in any\nChristian there had better be the basic change in orientation that\nJesus calls being born again.\n\n--clh]",

But if you know German and are in Germany, pick up all the\nreference books you think you can handle.

Is\n> there a lot of language instruction done?

Presbyterian\nand Reformed seminaries probably place a lot more emphasis on the biblical\nlanguages than others.  (Of course, any divinity school that has a doctoral\nprogram in biblical studies is going to have extensive language resources!  But\nthere are quite a few masters-degree-granting seminaries here at which the\nattitude seems to be more, \"Well, if you're *really* interested we'll give you\na semester-long course, but we don't understand why . . .\")\n\nThe pattern here at the Louisville Presbyterian Seminary is for first-year\nstudents to take intensive five-week introductory language courses in each\nlanguage, followed by semester-long exegesis courses.  (That is: Hebrew in\nAugust, OT exegesis in the fall; Greek in January, NT exegesis in the spring.) \nThese courses are required for graduation, a third or a half of the students,\nI'd say, take advanced biblical work that requires language work.",

    "Text": "From: jhpb@sarto.budd-lake.nj.us (Joseph H. Buehler)\nSubject: Re: SSPX schism ?\nOrganization: none\nLines: 240\n\nLarry L. Overacker writes, responding to Simon:\n\n   I may be interesting to see some brief selections posted to the\n   net.  My understanding is that SSPX does not consider ITSELF in\n   schism or legitimately excommunicated.  But that's really beside\n   the point.  What does the Roman Catholic church say?\n   Excommunication can be real apart from formal excommunication, as\n   provided for in canon law.\n\nHere's some of the theology involved for the interested.\n\nThere is confusion over this issue of the SSPX's \"schism\"; often the\nbasic problem is lack of an ability to distinguish between:\n\n- true obedience\n- false obedience\n- disobedience\n- schism\n\nTake the various classifications of obedience first.  There are 2\nimportant elements involved here for my purposes:\n\n1) a command\n2) the response made to the command\n\nAs far as the command goes, commands can be LEGITIMATE, such as the\nPope ordering Catholics to not eat meat on Fridays.  Or they can be\nILLEGITIMATE, such as the Pope ordering Catholics to worship the god\nDagon when every other full moon comes around.\n\nAs far as the response to a command goes, it can be to REFUSE to do\nwhat is commanded, or to COMPLY.\n\nMaking a table, there are thus 4 possibilites:\n\ncommand         response            name\n-----------------------------------------------------\nLEGITIMATE      COMPLY              true obedience\nILLEGITIMATE    REFUSE              true obedience\nLEGITIMATE      REFUSE              disobedience\nILLEGITIMATE    COMPLY              false obedience\n\nSo now you see where my 3 classifications of obedience come from.\n\nObedience is not solely a matter of compliance/refusal.  The nature of\nthe commands must also be taken into account; it is not enough to\nconsider someone's compliance or refusal and then say whether they are\n\"obedient\" or \"disobedient\".  You also have to take into consideration\nwhether the commands are good or bad.\n\nIn my example, if the Pope commands all Catholics to worship the god\nDagon, and they all refuse, they aren't being disobedient at all!\n\nAs far as the Society of Saint Pius X goes, they are certainly\nrefusing to comply with certain things the Pope desires.  But that\nalone is insufficient to allow one to label them \"disobedient\".  You\nalso have to consider the nature of the Papal desires.\n\nAnd there's the rub: SSPX says the Popes since Vatican II have been\ncommanding certain very bad things for the Church.  The Popes have of\ncourse disagreed.\n\nSo where are we?  Are we in another Arian heresy, complete with weak\nPopes?  Or are the SSPX priests modern Martin Luthers?  Well, the only\nway to answer that is to examine who is saying what, and what the\ntraditional teaching of the Church is.\n\nThe problem here is that very few Catholics have much of an idea of\nwhat is really going on, and what the issues are.  The religion of\nAmerican Catholics is especially defective in intellectual depth.  You\nwill never read about the issues being discussed in the Catholic press\nin this country.  (On the other hand, one Italian Catholic magazine I\nget -- 30 Days -- has had interviews with the Superior General of the\nSociety of Saint Pius X.)\n\nMany Catholics will decide to side with the Pope.  There is some\nsoundness in this, because the Papacy is infallible, so eventually\nsome Pope *will* straighten all this out.  But, on the other hand,\nthere is also unsoundness in this, in that, in the short term, the\nPopes may indeed be wrong, and such Catholics are doing nothing to\nhelp the situation by obeying them where they're wrong.  In fact, if\nthe situation is grave enough, they sin in obeying him.  At the very\nleast, they're wasting a great opportunity, because they are failing\nto love Christ in a heroic way at the very time that He needs this\nbadly.\n\nSchism... let's move on to schism.  What is it?\n\nSchism is a superset of disobedience (refusal to obey a legitimate\ncommand).  All schismatics are disobedient.  But it's a superset, so\nit doesn't work the other way around: not all disobeyers are\nschismatics.  The mere fact that the SSPX priests don't comply with\nthe Holy Father's desires doesn't make them schismatics.\n\nSo what is it that must be added to disobedience to constitute a\nschism?  Maybe this something else makes the SSPX priests schismatics.\n\nYou must add this: the rejection of the right to command.  Look in any\ndecent reference on Catholic theology, and that's what you'll find:\nthe distinguishing criterion of schism is rejection of the right to\ncommand.\n\nHere's what the Catholic Encyclopedia says, for example:\n\n    ... not every disobedience is a schism; in order to possess this\n    character it must include besides the trangression of the commands\n    of superiors, denial of their Divine right to command.\n    (from the CE article \"Schism\")\n\nIs the Society of Saint Pius X then schismatic?  The answer is a clear\nno: they say that the Pope is their boss.  They pray for him every\nday.  And that's all that matters as far as schism goes.\n\nWhat all this boils down to is this: if we leave aside the\nconsideration of the exact nature of their objections, their position\nis a legitimate one, as far as the Catholic theology of obedience and\nschism goes.  They are resisting certain Papal policies because they\nthink that they are clearly contrary to the traditional teaching of\nthe Papacy, and the best interests of the Church.  (In fact, someone\nwho finds himself in this situation has a *duty* to resist.)\n\nNow, what is the stance of Rome on all this?  Well, if you read the\nHoly Father's motu proprio \"Ecclesia Dei\", you can find out.  It's the\ndefinitive document on the subject.  A motu proprio is a specifically\nPapal act.  It's not the product of a Roman congregation, a letter\nthat the Pope has possibly never even read.  It's from the Pope\nhimself.  His boss is God... there's no one else to complain to.\n\nIn this document, the Holy Father says, among other things:\n\n1) The episcopal consecrations performed by Archbishop Lefebvre\nconstituted a schismatic act.\n\n2) Archbishop Lefebvre's problem was a misunderstanding of the nature\nof Tradtion.\n\nBoth are confusing: I fail to see the logic of the Pope's points.\n\nAs far as the episcopal consecrations go, I read an interesting\narticle in a translation of the Italian magazine \"Si Si No No\".  It\nall gets back to the question of jurisdiction.  If episcopal\nconsecrations imply rejection of the Pope's jurisdiction, then they\nwould truly constitute a schismatic act, justifying excommunication\nunder the current code of canon law.  But my problem with this is\nthis: according to the traditional theology of Holy Orders, episcopal\nconsecration does not confer jurisdiction.  It only confers the power\nof Order: the ability to confect the Sacraments.  Jurisdiction must be\nconferred by someone else with the power to confer it (such as the\nPope).  The Society bishops, knowing the traditional theology quite\nwell, take great pains to avoid any pretence of jurisdiction over\nanyone.  They simply confer those Sacraments that require a bishop.\n\nThe \"Si Si No No\" article was interesting in that it posited that the\nreason that the Pope said what he did is that he has a novel,\npost-Vatican II idea of Holy Orders.  According to this idea,\nepiscopal consecration *does* confer jurisdiction.  I lent the article\nto a friend, unfortunately, so can't tell you more.  I believe they\nquoted the new code of canon law in support of this idea.\n\nThe Pope's thinking on this point remains a great puzzle to me.\nThere's no way there is a schism, according to traditional Catholic\ntheology.  So why does the Pope think this?\n\nAs far as the points regarding the nature of Tradition goes, here's\nthe passage in question:\n\n    The root of this schismatic act can be discerned in an incomplete\n    and contradictory notion of Tradtion.  Incomplete, because it does\n    not take sufficiently into the account the living character of\n    Tradition, which, as the Second Vatican Council clearly taught,\n\n        comes from the apostles and progresses in the Church with the\n        help of the Holy Spirit.  There is a growth in insight into\n        the realities and words that are being passed on.  This comes\n        about in various ways.  It comes through the contemplation and\n        study of believers who ponder these things in their hearts.\n        It comes from the intimate sense of spiritual realities which\n        they experience.  And it comes from the preaching of those who\n        have received, along with their right of succession in the\n        espiscopate, the sure charism of truth.\n\n    But especially contradictory is a notion of Tradition which\n    opposes the universal Magisterium of the Church possessed by the\n    Bishop of Rome and the body of bishops.  It is impossible to\n    remain faithful to the Tradition while breaking the ecclesial bond\n    with him to whom, in the person of the Apostle Peter, Christ\n    himself entrusted the ministry of unity in His Church.\n\n    (Papal motu proprio \"Ecclesia Dei\", 2 July 1988)\n\nIt seems to me that the Holy Father is making two points here that can\nbe simplified to the following:\n\n- Vatican Council II has happened.\n- I am the Pope.\n\nThe argument being that either case is sufficient to prove that\nArchbishop Lefebvre must be wrong, because he disagrees with them.\nThis is weak, to say the least!\n\nIt would have helped clarify things more if the Pope had addressed\nArchbishop Lefebvre's concerns in detail.  What is John Paul II's\nstand on the social Kingship of Christ, as taught by Gregory XVI, Pius\nIX, Leo XIII, Pius XI and Pius XII, for example?  Are we supposed to\nignore what all these Popes said on the subject?\n\nI don't know what the future will hold, but the powers that be in the\nSSPX are still talking with Rome and trying to straighten things out.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\n[Many people would prefer to call a justified refusal to obey\n\"justified disobedience\" or even \"obeying God rather than man\".\nCalling a refusal to obey obedience puts us into a sort of Alice in\nWonderland world where words mean whatever we want them to mean.\n\nSimilarly, schism indicates a formal break in the church.  If the Pope\nsays that a schism exists, it seems to me that by definition it\nexists.  It may be that the Pope is on the wrong side of the break,\nthat there is no good reason for the break to exist, and that it will\nshortly be healed.  But how can one deny that it does in fact exist?\n\nIt seems to me that you are in grave danger of destroying the thing\nyou are trying to reform: the power of the papacy.  What good will it\ndo you if you become reconciled to the the Pope in the future, but in\nthe process, you have destroyed his ability to use the tools of church\ndiscipline?  It's one thing to hold that the Pope has misused his\npowers, and excommunicated someone wrongly.  It's something else to\nsay that his excommunication did not take effect, and the schism is\nall in his imagination.  That means that acts of church discipline are\nnot legal tools, but acts whose validity is open to debate.  Generally\nit has been liberal Catholics who have had problems with the Pope.\nWhile they have often objected to church sanctions, generally they\nhave admitted that the sanctions exist.  You are now opening the door\nto people simply ignoring papal decisions, claiming to be truly\nobeying by disobeying, and to be in communion while excommunicated.\nThis would seem to be precisely the denial of Divine right to command\nthat you say defines schism.\n\n--clh]",

If\nyou have something to say concerning one of these questions and which isn't\ncovered by the answer given, please feel free to make your point.\n\nOverview of contents:\n\n   \"What is the purpose of this newsgroup?\"\n   \"Hitler was an atheist!\"\n   \"The Bible proves it\"\n   \"Pascal's Wager\"\n   \"What is Occam's Razor?\"\n   \"Why it's good to believe in Jesus\"\n   \"Why I know that God exists\"\n   \"Einstein and \"God does not play dice\"\"\n   \"Everyone worships something\"\n   \"Why there must be a causeless cause\"\n   \"The universe is so complex it must have been designed\"\n   \"Independent evidence that the Bible is true\"\n   \"Godel's Incompleteness Theorem\"\n   \"George Bush on atheism and patriotism\"\n   \"I know where hell is!\"\n   \"Biblical contradictions wanted\"\n   \"The USA is a Christian nation\"\n   \"The USA is not a Christian nation\"\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSubject: What is the purpose of this newsgroup?\n\nTypical posting:\n\nWhy have a newsgroup about atheism?  Why do atheists organize in groups?  \nWhat is there to discuss?\n\nResponse:\n\nMany things are discussed here, including:\n\n* Whether it is reasonable to feign theism in order to avoid upsetting one's\n  family\n* Prayer in schools\n* Discrimination against atheists\n* Sunday trading laws\n* The Satanic Child Abuse myth\n* Whether one should be an overt atheist or 'stay in the closet'\n* How religious societies prey (sic) on new college students\n* How to get rid of unwanted proselytizers\n* Whether religion is a danger to society and/or the individual\n* Why people become atheists\n\nOf course, inevitably alt.atheism tends to attract evangelical Christians\nlooking for someone to convert.  Most readers of the newsgroup don't \nwant to be preached to, although a few seem to derive perverse pleasure \nfrom tearing apart particularly ill-considered or uninformed postings.\n\n------------------------------\n\nSubject: Hitler was an atheist!\n\nTypical posting:\n\nHitler was an atheist, and look at what he did!\n\nResponse:\n\nAdolf Hitler was emphatically not an atheist.  As he said himself:\n\n   The folkish-minded man, in particular, has the sacred duty, each in\n   his own denomination, of making _people_stop_just_talking_\n   superficially_of_God's_will,_and_actually_fulfill_God's_will,_and_\n   not_let_God's_word_be_desecrated._[orig. ital.]\n\n   For God's will gave men their form, their essence, and their\n   abilities.  Anyone who destroys His work is declaring war on the\n   Lord's creation, the divine will.  Therefore, let every man be\n   active, each in his own denomination if you please, and let every\n   man take it as his first and most sacred duty to oppose anyone who\n   in his activity by word or deed steps outside the confines of his\n   religious community and tries to butt into the other.\n\n   [...]\n\n   Hence today I believe that I am acting in accordance with the will\n   of the Almighty Creator: _by_defending_myself_against_the_Jew,_I_am_\n   fighting_for_the_work_of_the_Lord._[orig. ital.]\n\n          -- Adolf Hitler, from \"Mein Kampf\", trans. Ralph Mannheim.\n\nOf course, someone bad believing something does not make that belief\nwrong.  It's also entirely possible that Hitler was lying when he claimed \nto believe in God.  We certainly can't conclude that he's an atheist, \nthough.\n\n------------------------------\n\nSubject: The Bible proves it\n\nTypical posting:\n\nIn the Bible it says that...\n\nResponse:\n\nMost of the readers of alt.atheism feel that the Bible is of questionable\naccuracy, as it was written thousands of years ago by many authors who were\nrecording oral tradition that existed many years before.  Thus, any claimed\n'truth' in it is of questionable legitimacy.  This isn't to say that The\nBible has no truth in it; simply that any truth must be examined before being\naccepted.\n\nMany of the readers of this group also feel that because any passage is\nsubject to \"interpretation\", any claim that a passage 'means' one thing and\none thing only is not legitimate.\n\nNote that this feeling tends to extend to other books.\n\nIt is also remarkable to many atheists that theists tend to ignore other\nequally plausible religious books in favour of those of their own religion.\n\n------------------------------\n\nSubject: Pascal's Wager\n\nTypical posting:\n\nIf you believe in God and turn out to be incorrect, you have lost nothing --\nbut if you don't believe in God and turn out to be incorrect, you will go to\nhell. Therefore it is foolish to be an atheist.\n\nResponse:\n\nThis argument is known as Pascal's Wager.  It has several flaws.\n\nFirstly, it does not indicate which religion to follow.  Indeed, there are\nmany mutually exclusive and contradictory religions out there.  This is often\ndescribed as the \"avoiding the wrong hell\" problem.  If a person is a\nfollower of religion X, he may end up in religion Y's version of hell.\n\nSecondly, the statement that \"If you believe in God and turn out to be\nincorrect, you have lost nothing\" is not true.  Suppose you're believing in\nthe wrong God -- the true God might punish you for your foolishness.\nConsider also the deaths that have resulted from people rejecting medicine in\nfavour of prayer.\n\nAnother flaw in the argument is that it is based on the assumption that \nthe two possibilities are equally likely -- or at least, that they are of \ncomparable likelihood.  If, in fact, the possibility of there being a God \nis close to zero, the argument becomes much less persuasive.  So sadly the\nargument is only likely to convince those who believe already.\n\nAlso, many feel that for intellectually honest people, belief is based on \nevidence, with some amount of intuition.  It is not a matter of will or \ncost-benefit analysis.\n\nFormally speaking, the argument consists of four statements:\n\n  1. One does not know whether God exists.\n  2. Not believing in God is bad for one's eternal soul if God does\n     exist.\n  3. Believing in God is of no consequence if God does not exist.\n  4. Therefore it is in one's interest to believe in God.\n\nThere are two approaches to the argument.  The first is to view 1 as an\nassumption, and 2 as a consequence of it.  One problem with this approach, in\nthe abstract, is that it creates information from no information.  This is\nconsidered invalid in information theory.  Statement 1 indicates one has no\ninformation about God -- but statement 2 indicates that beneficial information\ncan be gained from the absolute lack of information about God.  This violates\ninformation entropy -- information has been extracted from no information, at\nno \"cost\".\n\nThe alternative approach is to claim that 1 and 2 are both assumptions.  The\nproblem with this is that 2 is then basically an assumption which states the\nChristian position, and only a Christian will agree with that assumption. The\nargument thus collapses to \"If you are a Christian, it is in your interests\nto believe in God\" -- a rather vacuous tautology, and not the way Pascal\nintended the argument to be viewed.\n\nThe biggest reason why Pascal's wager is a failure is that if God is\nomniscient he will certainly know who really believes and who believes as\na wager.  He will spurn the latter... assuming he actually cares at all\nwhether people believe in him.\n\n------------------------------\n\nSubject: What is Occam's Razor?\n\nTypical posting:\n\nPeople keep talking about Occam's Razor.  What is it?\n\nResponse:\n\nWilliam of Occam formulated a principle which has become known as Occam's \nRazor.  In its original form, it said \"Do not multiply entities \nunnecessarily.\"  That is, if you can explain something without supposing\nthe existence of some entity, then do so.\n\nNowadays when people refer to Occam's Razor, they generally express it \nmore generally, for example as \"Take the simplest solution\".\n\nThe relevance to atheism is that we can look at two possible explanations \nfor what we see around us:\n\n1. There is an incredibly intricate and complex universe out there, which\ncame into being as a result of natural processes.\n\n2. There is an incredibly intricate and complex universe out there, and \nthere is also a God who created the universe.  Clearly this God must be \nof non-zero complexity.\n\nGiven that both explanations fit the facts, Occam's Razor might suggest \nthat we should take the simpler of the two -- solution number one.\nUnfortunately, some argue that there is a third even more simple solution:\n\n3. There isn't an incredibly intricate and complex universe out there.  \nWe just imagine that there is.\n\nThis third option leads us logically towards solipsism, which many people \nfind unacceptable.\n \n------------------------------\n\nSubject: Why it's good to believe in Jesus\n\nTypical posting:\n\nI want to tell people about the virtues and benefits of my religion.\n\nResponse:\n\nPreaching is not appreciated.\n\nFeel free to talk about your religion, but please do not write postings that\nare on a \"conversion\" theme.  Such postings do not belong on alt.atheism and\nwill be rejected from alt.atheism.moderated (try the newsgroup\ntalk.religion.misc).\n\nYou would doubtless not welcome postings from atheists to your favourite\nnewsgroup in an attempt to convert you; please do unto others as you would\nhave them do unto you!\n\nOften theists make their basic claims about God in the form of lengthy\nanalogies or parables.  Be aware that atheists have heard of God and know the\nbasic claims about him; if the sole purpose of your parable is to tell\natheists that God exists and brings salvation, you may as well not post it,\nsince it tells us nothing we have not been told before.\n\n------------------------------\n\nSubject: Why I know that God exists\n\nTypical posting:\n\nI *know* from personal experience and prayer that God exists.\n\nResponse:\n\nJust as many theists have personal evidence that the being they worship\nexists, so many atheists have personal evidence that such beings do not\nexist.  That evidence varies from person to person.\n\nFurthermore, without wishing to dismiss your evidence out of hand, many\npeople have claimed all kinds of unlikely things -- that they have been\nabducted by UFOs, visited by the ghost of Elvis, and so on.\n\n------------------------------\n\nSubject: Einstein and \"God does not play dice\"\n\nTypical posting:\n\nAlbert Einstein believed in God.  Do you think you're cleverer than him?\n\nResponse:\n\nEinstein did once comment that \"God does not play dice [with the universe]\". \nThis quotation is commonly mentioned to show that Einstein believed in the\nChristian God.  Used this way, it is out of context; it refers to Einstein's\nrefusal to accept the uncertainties indicated by quantum theory. Furthermore,\nEinstein's religious background was Jewish rather than Christian.\n\nA better quotation showing what Einstein thought about God is the following:\n\"I believe in Spinoza's God who reveals himself in the orderly harmony of\nwhat exists, not in a God who concerns himself with fates and actions of\nhuman beings.\"\n\nEinstein was unable to accept Quantum Theory because of his belief in an\nobjective, orderly reality; a reality which would not be subject to random\nevents and which would not be dependent upon the observer.  He believed that\nQM was incomplete, and that a better theory would have no need for\nstatistical interpretations.  So far no such better theory has been found,\nand much evidence suggests that it never will be.\n\nA longer quote from Einstein appears in \"Science, Philosophy, and Religion, A\nSymposium\", published by the Conference on Science, Philosophy and Religion\nin Their Relation to the Democratic Way of Life, Inc., New York, 1941.  In\nit he says:\n\n  \"The more a man is imbued with the ordered regularity of all events\n   the firmer becomes his conviction that there is no room left by the side\n   of this ordered regularity for causes of a different nature.  For him\n   neither the rule of human nor the rule of divine will exists as an\n   independent cause of natural events.  To be sure, the doctrine of a\n   personal God interfering with natural events could never be\n   *refuted* [italics his], in the real sense, by science, for this\n   doctrine can always take refuge in those domains in which scientific\n   knowledge has not yet been able to set foot.\n\n   But I am convinced that such behavior on the part of representatives\n   of religion would not only be unworthy but also fatal.  For a doctrine\n   which is to maintain itself not in clear light but only in the dark,\n   will of necessity lose its effect on mankind, with incalculable harm\n   to human progress.  In their struggle for the ethical good, teachers\n   of religion must have the stature to give up the doctrine of a personal\n   God, that is, give up that source of fear and hope which in the past\n   placed such vast power in the hands of priests.  In their labors they\n   will have to avail themselves of those forces which are capable\n   of cultivating the Good, the True, and the Beautiful in humanity\n   itself.  This is, to be sure, a more difficult but an incomparably\n   more worthy task...\"\n\nEinstein has also said:\n\n  \"It was, of course, a lie what you read about my religous convictions,\n   a lie which is being systematically repeated.  I do not believe in a\n   personal God and I have never denied this but have expressed it clearly.\n   If something is in me which can be called religious then it is the\n   unbounded admiration for the structure of the world so far as our\n   science can reveal it.\"\n\nThe latter quote is from \"Albert Einstein: The Human Side\", edited by Helen \nDukas and Banesh Hoffman, and published by Princeton University Press.  \nAlso from the same book:\n\n  \"I do not believe in immortality of the individual, and I consider ethics\n   to be an exclusively human concern with no superhuman authority behind \n   it.\"\n\nOf course, the fact that Einstein chose not to believe in Christianity does \nnot in itself imply that Christianity is false.\n\n------------------------------\n\nSubject: Everyone worships something\n\nTypical posting:\n\nEveryone worships something, whether it's money, power or God.\n\nResponse:\n\nIf that is true, everyone is a polytheist.  Theists care just as much about\nthose things that atheists care about.  If the atheists' reactions to (for\nexample) their families amount to worship then so do the theists'.\n\n------------------------------\n\nSubject: Why there must be a causeless cause\n\nTypical posting:\n\nSets of integers that have a lower bound each have a smallest member, so\nchains of causes must all have a first element, a causeless cause.\n\nResponse:\n\nThe set of real numbers greater than zero has a definite lower bound, but has\nno smallest member.\n\nFurther, even if it is true that there must be a causeless cause, that does\nnot imply that that cause must be a conscious supernatural entity, and\nespecially not that any such entity must match the description favoured by\nany particular religion.\n\n------------------------------\n\nSubject: The universe is so complex it must have been designed\n\nTypical posting:\n\nThe presence of design in the universe proves there is a God.  Surely you\ndon't think all this appeared here just by chance?\n\nResponse:\n\nThis is known as the Argument From Design.\n\nIt is a matter of dispute whether there is any element of design in the\nuniverse. Those who believe that the complexity and diversity of living\ncreatures on the earth is evidence of a creator are best advised to read the\nnewsgroup talk.origins for a while.\n\nThere is insufficient space to summarize both sides of that debate here.\nHowever, the conclusion is that there is no scientific evidence in favour of\nso-called Scientific Creationism. Furthermore, there is much evidence,\nobservation and theory that can explain many of the complexities of the\nuniverse and life on earth.\n\nThe origin of the Argument by Design is a feeling that the existence of\nsomething as incredibly intricate as, say, a human is so improbable that\nsurely it can't have come about by chance; that surely there must be some \nexternal intelligence directing things so that humans come from the chaos\ndeliberately.\n\nBut if human intelligence is so improbable, surely the existence of a mind\ncapable of fashioning an entire universe complete with conscious beings must\nbe immeasurably more unlikely?  The approach used to argue in favour of the\nexistence of a creator can be turned around and applied to the Creationist\nposition.\n\nThis leads us to the familiar theme of \"If a creator created the universe,\nwhat created the creator?\", but with the addition of spiralling \nimprobability.  The only way out is to declare that the creator was not\ncreated and just \"is\" (or \"was\").\n\nFrom here we might as well ask what is wrong with saying that the universe\njust \"is\" without introducing a creator?  Indeed Stephen Hawking, in his book\n\"A Brief History of Time\", explains his theory that the universe is closed\nand finite in extent, with no beginning or end.\n\nThe Argument From Design is often stated by analogy, in the so-called \nWatchmaker Argument.  One is asked to imagine that one has found a watch on\nthe beach.  Does one assume that it was created by a watchmaker, or that it\nevolved naturally?  Of course one assumes a watchmaker.  Yet like the \nwatch, the universe is intricate and complex; so, the argument goes, the \nuniverse too must have a creator.\n\nThe Watchmaker analogy suffers from three particular flaws, over and above \nthose common to all Arguments By Design.  Firstly, a watchmaker creates \nwatches from pre-existing materials, whereas God is claimed to have \ncreated the universe from nothing.  These two sorts of creation are \nclearly fundamentally different, and the analogy is therefore rather weak.\n\nSecondly, a watchmaker makes watches, but there are many other things in \nthe world.  If we walked further along the beach and found a nuclear \nreactor, we wouldn't assume it was created by the watchmaker.  The argument \nwould therefore suggest a multitude of creators, each responsible for a \ndifferent part of creation.\n\nFinally, in the first part of the watchmaker argument we conclude that \nthe watch is not part of nature because it is ordered, and therefore \nstands out from the randomness of nature.  Yet in the second part of the \nargument, we start from the position that the universe is obviously not \nrandom, but shows elements of order.  The Watchmaker argument is thus \ninternally inconsistent.\n\n------------------------------\n\nSubject: Independent evidence that the Bible is true\n\nTypical posting:\n\nThe events of the New Testament are confirmed by independent documentary\nevidence.  For example...\n\nResponse:\n\nThe writings of Josephus are often mentioned as independent documentary\nevidence.\n\nEarly versions of Josephus's work are thought not to have mentioned Jesus or\nJames; the extant version discusses John in a non-Christian context.  Many\nscholars believe that the original mentioned Jesus and James in passing, but\nthat this was expanded by Christian copyists.  Several \"reconstructions\" of\nthe original text have been published to this effect.\n\nMuch information appears in the Ecclesiastical History of Eusebius (about 320\nC.E.).  It is worthless as historical material because of the deliberate\nfalsification of the wily Eusebius who is generally acknowledged as 'the\nfirst thoroughly dishonest historian of antiquity.' It is Eusebius who is\ngenerally given the title of authorship for this material.\n\nAside from the New Testament, the biographical information about Jesus is\nmore well-documented.  For further information, please consult the Frequently\nAsked Questions file for the newsgroup soc.religion.christian.\n\n------------------------------\n\nSubject: Godel's Incompleteness Theorem\n\nTypical posting:\n\nGodel's Incompleteness Theorem demonstrates that it is impossible for the\nBible to be both true and complete.\n\nResponse:\n\nGodel's First Incompleteness Theorem says that in any consistent formal \nsystem which is sufficiently expressive that it can model ordinary \narithmetic, one can formulate expressions which can never be proven to be \nvalid or invalid ('true' or 'false') within that formal system.  (Technically\nspeaking, the system must also be recursive; that is, there must be a decision\nprocedure for determining whether a given string is an axiom within the formal \nsystem.)\n\nEssentially, all such systems can formulate what is known as a \"Liar \nParadox.\"  The classic Liar Paradox sentence in ordinary English is \"This \nsentence is false.\"  Note that if a proposition is undecidable, the formal \nsystem cannot even deduce that it is undecidable.\n\nThe logic used in theological discussions is rarely well defined, so claims\nthat Godel's Incompleteness Theorem demonstrates that it is impossible to\nprove or disprove) the existence of God are worthless in isolation.\n\nOne can trivially define a formal system in which it is possible to prove the\nexistence of God, simply by having the existence of God stated as an axiom. \nThis is unlikely to be viewed by atheists as a convincing proof, however.\n\nIt may be possible to succeed in producing a formal system built on axioms\nthat both atheists and theists agree with.  It may then be possible to show\nthat Godel's Incompleteness Theorem holds for that system.  However, that\nwould still not demonstrate that it is impossible to prove that God exists\nwithin the system.  Furthermore, it certainly wouldn't tell us anything about\nwhether it is possible to prove the existence of God generally.\n\nNote also that all of these hypothetical formal systems tell us nothing about\nthe actual existence of God; the formal systems are just abstractions.\n\nAnother frequent claim is that Godel's Incompleteness Theorem demonstrates\nthat a religious text (the Bible, the Book of Mormon or whatever) cannot be\nboth consistent and universally applicable. Religious texts are not formal\nsystems, so such claims are nonsense.\n\n------------------------------\n\nSubject: George Bush on atheism and patriotism\n\nTypical posting:\n\nDid George Bush really say that atheists should not be considered citizens?\n\nResponse:\n\nThe following exchange took place at the Chicago airport between Robert I.\nSherman of American Atheist Press and George Bush, on August 27 1988. Sherman\nis a fully accredited reporter, and was present by invitation as a member of\nthe press corps.  The Republican presidential nominee was there to announce\nfederal disaster relief for Illinois.  The discussion turned to the\npresidential primary:\n\n RS: \"What will you do to win the votes of Americans who are atheists?\"\n\n GB: \"I guess I'm pretty weak in the atheist community.  Faith in\n      God is important to me.\"\n\n RS: \"Surely you recognize the equal citizenship and patriotism of\n      Americans who are atheists?\"\n\n GB: \"No, I don't know that atheists should be considered as citizens,\n      nor should they be considered patriots.  This is one nation under\n      God.\"\n\n RS: \"Do you support as a sound constitutional principle the separation\n      of state and church?\"\n\n GB: \"Yes, I support the separation of church and state.  I'm just not\n      very high on atheists.\"\n\nUPI reported on May 8, 1989, that various atheist organizations were\nstill angry over the remarks.\n\nThe exchange appeared in the Boulder Daily Camera on Monday February 27,\n1989.  It can also be found in \"Free Enquiry\" magazine, Fall 1988 issue,\nVolume 8, Number 4, page 16.\n\nOn October 29, 1988, Mr. Sherman had a confrontation with Ed Murnane,\ncochairman of the Bush-Quayle '88 Illinois campaign.  This concerned a\nlawsuit Mr. Sherman had filed to stop the Community Consolidated School\nDistrict 21 (Chicago, Illinois) from forcing his first-grade Atheist son to\npledge allegiance to the flag of the United States as \"one nation under God\"\n(Bush's phrase).  The following conversation took place:\n \n RS: \"American Atheists filed the Pledge of Allegiance lawsuit yesterday.\n      Does the Bush campaign have an official response to this filing?\"\n \n EM: \"It's bullshit.\"\n \n RS: \"What is bullshit?\"\n \n EM: \"Everything that American Atheists does, Rob, is bullshit.\"\n \n RS: \"Thank you for telling me what the official position of the Bush\n      campaign is on this issue.\"\n\n EM: \"You're welcome.\"\n\nAfter Bush's election, American Atheists wrote to Bush asking him to retract\nhis statement.  On February 21st 1989, C. Boyden Gray, Counsel to the\nPresident, replied on White House stationery that Bush substantively stood by\nhis original statement, and wrote:\n\n  \"As you are aware, the President is a religious man who neither supports\n   atheism nor believes that atheism should be unnecessarily encouraged or\n   supported by the government.\"\n\nFor further information, contact American Atheist Veterans at the American\nAtheist Press's Cameron Road address.\n\n------------------------------\n\nSubject: I know where hell is!\n\nTypical posting:\n\nI know where Hell is!  Hell is in Norway!\n\nResponse:\n\nThere are several towns called \"Hell\" in various countries around the\nworld, including Norway and the USA.  Whilst this information is mildly\namusing the first time one hears it, readers of alt.atheism are now \ngetting pretty fed up with hearing it every week.\n\n------------------------------\n\nSubject: Biblical contradictions wanted\n\nTypical posting:\n\nDoes anyone have a list of Biblical contradictions?\n\nResponse:\n \nAmerican Atheist Press publish an atheist's handbook detailing Biblical\ncontradictions. See the accompanying posting on Atheist Resources for\ndetails.\n\nThere is a file containing some Biblical contradictions available from the\narchive-server@mantis.co.uk. See the contacts file for more information.\n\n------------------------------\n\nSubject: The USA is a Christian nation\n\nTypical posting:\n\nBecause of the religious beliefs of the founding fathers, shouldn't the\nUnited States be considered a Christian nation?\n\nResponse:\n\nBased upon the writings of several important founding fathers, it is clear\nthat they never intended the US to be a Christian nation.  Here are some\nquotes; there are many more.\n\n  \"What influence, in fact, have ecclesiastical establishments had on society?\n   In some instances they have been seen to erect a spiritual tyranny on the\n   ruins of the civil authority; on many instances they have been seen\n   upholding the thrones of political tyranny; in no instance have they been\n   the guardians of the liberties of the people.  Rulers who wish to subvert\n   the public liberty may have found an established clergy convenient\n   auxiliaries. A just government, instituted to secure and perpetuate it,\n   needs them not.\"\n      - James Madison, \"A Memorial and Remonstrance\", 1785\n\n  \"I almost shudder at the thought of alluding to the most fatal example of\n   the abuses of grief which the history of mankind has preserved--the Cross.\n   Consider what calamities that engine of grief has produced!\"\n      - John Adams, in a letter to Thomas Jefferson\n\n  \"History I believe furnishes no example of a priest-ridden people\n   maintaining a free civil government.  This marks the lowest grade of\n   ignorance, of which their political as well as religious leaders will\n   always avail themselves for their own purpose.\"\n\n      - Thomas Jefferson to Baron von Humboldt, 1813\n\n  \"I cannot conceive otherwise than that He, the Infinite Father, expects or\n   requires no worship or praise from us, but that He is even infinitely\n   above it.\"\n\n      - Benjamin Franklin, from \"Articles of Belief and Acts of Religion\",\n        Nov. 20, 1728\n\n------------------------------\n\nSubject: The USA is not a Christian nation\n\nTypical posting:\n\nIs it true that George Washington said that the United States is not in any\nsense founded upon the Christian religion?\n\nResponse:\n\nNo.  The quotation often given is in fact from Article XI of the 1797 Treaty\nof Tripoli (8 Stat 154, Treaty Series 358):\n\n   Article 11\n\n   As the government of the United States of America is not in any sense\n   founded on the Christian Religion, -- as it has in itself no character of\n   enmity against the laws, religion or tranquility of Musselmen, -- and as\n   the said States never have entered into any war or act of hostility\n   against any Mehomitan nation, it is declared by the parties that no\n   pretext arising from religious opinions shall ever produce an interruption\n   of the harmony existing between the two countries.\n\nThe text may be found in the Congressional Record or in treaty collections\nsuch as Charles Bevans' \"Treaties and Other International Agreements of the\nUnited States of America 1776-1949\", vol. 11 (pp. 1070-1080).\n\nThe English text of the Treaty of Tripoli was approved by the U.S. Senate on\nJune 7, 1797 and ratified by President John Adams on June 10, 1797.  It was\nrecently discovered that the Arabic version of the treaty not only lacks the\nquotation, it lacks Article XI altogether.\n\nThe person who translated the Arabic to English was Joel Barlow, Consul\nGeneral at Algiers, a close friend of Thomas Paine -- and an opponent of\nChristianity.  It is possible that Barlow made up Article XI, but since there\nis no Arabic version of that article to be found, it's hard to say.\n\nIn 1806 a new Treaty of Tripoli was ratified which no longer contained the\nquotation.\n\n\nEnd of FAQ Digest\n*****************\nÿ",

There are no known valid logical arguments for the existence\nof gods, nor is there any empirical evidence that they exist.

The theist believes that faith is an acceptable\nbasis for a belief in gods, even if he rejects faith as reliable at\nother times, for example in his work as a scientist.  The atheist\nbelieves that only logic and empirical evidence lead to reliable\nknowledge.

From a theological bent, those who lived\nimmediately after the flood, such as Noah, Ham, his son Cush, and his son\nNimrod had a much stronger appreciation of Divine wrath.  They also had a\nstronger understanding of the True God.  In fact, this immediacy was a cause of\nhardship for some, so much so that Atlas, who is seen with heavens resting on\nhis shoulders.  But this is not merely the physical heavens that he is lifting.\n It is to put God and the strict spirituality of His law at a distance, and\nthus he became the \"Elevator of the heavens.\"  This \"god\" made men able to\n\"feel\" as if heaven were afar off and \"as if either the God of Heaven could not\nsee through the dark cloud, or did not regard with displeasure the breakers of\nHis laws.\"  It is interesting to see that it was that was titled \"Emancipator\"\nor \"Deliverer\"  or Phoroneus. It was Nimrod who invaded the patriarchal system\nand abridged the liberties of mankind, yet was worship for having given many\nbenefits.  He was a deliverer all right but not as we think of Christ as a\nDeliverer.  One delivered from a conscious feeling of God's wrath, the other\nactually performed a delivery from Gods wrath and it is up to us to accept it\nas true.\n\n>The question of what happens to human beings who died before Christ is\n>an ever present one with Christians.

From the time of Adam, those who looked forward to\nthe coming \"Anointed One\" and put their faith in the fact that it was God who\nwas to do the provision, were accounted as righteous.  But up to the\nCrucifixion, their sins were only covered, not taken away.  Therefore, the\ndispensation of the Church views the accountability of sin the same, but see it\nas a completed action.  Rom's makes it clear that it has always been salvation\nvia faith and nothing else.\n\n>It is possible to experience eternity in a passing moment.

But it is a two edged sword. For some do not want the\nunderlying reality to be revealed.  They were not known as \"mystery\" religions\nfor no reason.  There was the public side of them and there was the private\nside, that was so protected that the initiates to an oath of death if they\nrevealed that private side.  That is why it is so hard to bring their teachings\nto light. The \"Mystery of Iniquity\" that we find in the Bible, correlates to\nthis I think.  The primary object of the mysteries was to introduce privately,\nlittle by little, under the seal of secrecy and sanction of oath, what it would\nnot have been safe to openly profess was the true religion.  Case in point\ntoday might be the Masons.

If you\nare a student of history, you will come to see that much of what Greece came to\nexpound to the world as their original, was just an adulteration of that which\nthey had taken from conquered countries.  The soul is clearly mentioned and\ndiscussed at length in the Egyptian religions. As was the unity of God and also\nthe trinity of God.

Who is the clay to talk back to the potter? But we find a\ncontrary view in Scripture. When God proposes to destroy the city of\nSodom (Genesis 18), Abraham says:\n\n + Suppose that there are some good men in the city.\n + Will you destroy the righteous along with the wicked?\n + Far be it from you, Lord, to do such a thing!\n + Shall not the Judge of all the earth do right?\n\nI am told that the Hebrew is actually a bit stronger than this, and\ncan perhaps be better rendered (dynamic equivalence) as\n\n + Shame on you, Lord, if you do such a thing!\n\nThere are those who say that the definition of \"good\" is \"whatever\nGod happens to want.\" But if that is so, then the statement that God\nis good has no meaning.  It simply says that God does what He wants.\nThat being the case, no one can either love or obey God because He\nis good. The only motive left for obeying Him is that He is\npowerful. Just as it makes sense to obey a dictator, even when he\ntells you to round up all Jews and exterminate them, because if you\ndefy him you might end up in the gas chamber yourself, so it makes\nsense to obey God, because He has the power to punish you if you\ndon't. This ethical theory I take to be in radical contradiction to\nGenesis 18 and to Christianity in general.\n\nAny theory that makes our moral judgements worthless makes any\nfurther discussion of morality (or of the goodness of God)\nmeaningless. However, it does not follow that our moral judgements\nare always infallible in particular cases, still less our judgements\nin particular cases about the course of action most likely to\nachieve a good result.\n\nWhen I read the Scriptural accounts of the actions of God in\nhistory, those actions often seem to me very different from what I\nmight expect of a God who loves us and desires what is best for us.\nMoreover, leaving the Scriptures aside, and considering the natural\nworld, I find that Nature is often very different from what I might\nexpect if it were the work of a benevolent deity.  (Origen said:\n\"Those who believe that the Author of Nature is also the Author of\nthe Scriptures must expect to find in the Scriptures the same sort\nof difficulties that they find in Nature.\")\n\nNow, that some such difficulties should exist is not in itself an\nargument against the existence, power, wisdom, and goodness of God.\nOn the contrary, their ABSENCE would be such an argument. Suppose\nthat I am watching Bobby Fisher play chess, and suppose that every\ntime he makes a move, I find myself nodding and saying: \"Good move!\nJust what I was expecting him to do.  Same move I would have made if\nI were playing.\" That would be a sign that Fisher is no better a\nchess player than myself. Given that he is better, I expect that at\nleast some of his moves will have me thinking, \"Now, what do suppose\ninduced him to do that?\" or even, \"Boy, that was a real slip -- he's\njust thrown the game away!\" Similarly, if God understands the\nworkings of the universe better than I do, it is to be expected that\nsometimes it will look to me as if He has made a mistake.\n\nOne difference between Fisher at the chessboard and God at the\ncontrols of the universe is that I can see the end of the chess\ngame. If Fisher wins, I revise my earlier inference that it was\ncarelessness that made him lose his queen 23 moves earlier.\nHowever, if he loses, and particularly if I can see that there was a\ntime when he had an opportunity for a checkmate in two moves and did\nnot take it, then I know that he is not as good a player as I had\nthought.\n\nWith God, on the other hand, I shall not in this life see the total\nresult of some of His actions. Therefore, my grounds for judging\nthat I have seen a bad move on His part must always be far shakier\nthan my grounds for making a similar judgement about Fisher.\n\n     *****     *****     *****     *****     *****\n\nIn the book of Genesis, we read that Joseph's ten older brothers,\nwho (with good reason) found  him insufferable, conspired to sell\nhim into slavery in Egypt. There he eventually became Viceroy, and\nwhen there was a famine in Canaan, he was able to provide for his\nfamily. When his brothers nervously apologized, he told them: \"Do\nnot worry. You meant to do me evil, but God turned it into good.\"\n\nI once heard a rabbi speak on this text. He said:\n\n        The history of the Jews is largely a history of events\n   that look like catastrophes that threaten the continued\n   survival of the religion, or the people, or both. But,\n   amazingly, those events turn out to be the saving of the Jews\n   and of Judaism.\n        The sale of Joseph by his brothers looked like the breakup\n   of the family.  But in fact, it ended with a reconciliation of\n   the quarrel between them. The famine that drove the family out\n   of Canaan looked like a misfortune for them.  But in fact, if\n   they had stayed in Canaan, they would almost certainly have\n   intermarried with the Canaanites and been assimilated into\n   their culture.  Their oppression by the Egyptians a few\n   generations after their arrival in Egypt again looked like a\n   disaster. But God used it to bring them out of Egypt, and into\n   the Promised Land.\n        Here the people built a Temple, and regularly offered\n   sacrifices. But the Babylonians captured Jerusalem and Judea,\n   destroyed Temple and city and countryside, and deported most of\n   the people to Babylon. You might have thought that that would\n   be the end of the people and the religion. But it was not.\n   Living in Canaan, the people had been under constant danger of\n   assimilation.  Again and again, they had turned from the\n   worship of the LORD to the worship of the Canaanite fertility\n   cults, with their ritual prostitution and ritual human\n   sacrifice. The Babylonian captivity put a stop to that. Never\n   again did the Jews show any interest in polytheism or idolatry.\n   Neither the worship of the Canaanites mor that of the\n   Babylonians ever again had a foothold among them.\n        Nor is that all. Judaism had been in danger of becoming\n   simply a system of sacrifices and Temple observances. The only\n   prescribed acts of worship consisted of coming to Jerusalem\n   every so often and offering a sacrifice. During the Captivity,\n   with the Temple gone, the Jews invented the synagogue, a place\n   of meeting for reading and study and discussion of the\n   Scriptures. They came to realize clearly, what they were in\n   danger of forgetting while they continued to live in Judea,\n   that God is not simply a local or tribal deity, not just the\n   controller of the land of Canaan, or the patron of the Jewish\n   people, but the Creator of the world, and the Ruler and Judge\n   of all humans everywhere.\n        Time passed, and the Babylonian Empire was replaced by\n   that of the Persians, and then that of the Greeks, or rather\n   the Macedonians. The ruler, Antiochus Epiphanes, was determined\n   to stamp out Judaism, and to this end he made the reading and\n   the study of the Torah punishable by death. Again, one might\n   think that this would be the end of Judaism. But it was not.\n   The people met for worship, and instead of reading the Torah\n   portion appointed for the day, they would read some passage\n   from the prophets that had a similar theme, and then discuss\n   that.  Before this time, the Torah, the so-called Five Books of\n   Moses (Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy)\n   were the only books read and studied in the synagogue.  If it\n   had not been for Antiochus, the books of the prophets would\n   probably have been forgotten altogether. His hatred for Judaism\n   saved them.\n\n        [Other examples here omitted for brevity's sake.]\n\n        Some of you may remember that Julie Andrews first became\n   famous as Eliza Doolittle in the stage production of MY FAIR\n   LADY. When Warner Brothers undertook to make a movie of it,\n   everyone expected that Julie, who had been so magnificent on\n   stage, would play the same role in the movie. Instead, the\n   studio decided to go with an established screen star, and cast\n   Audrey Hepburn.  Julie Andrews was naturally crushed. But she\n   later realized that if she had played the screen role, she\n   would have been type-cast for life as an Elize Doolittle type.\n   It would have been a disaster for her. As it was, Walt Disney\n   offered her the role of Mary Poppins, and she won an Oscar for\n   it.  At the presentation, she stood there, smiling, and looking\n   at Walt Disney, she said, \"And now, my special thanks to the\n   man who made all this possible -- JACK WARNER!\" It was the most\n   memorable line of the evening.\n        In a similar spirit, we Jews might thank the men who in\n   the providence of God have preserved Judaism, and kept it alive\n   to this day, beginning with Joseph's brothers, and continuing\n   with two Pharaohs, with Nebuchadnezzar, with Antiochus\n   Epiphanes....\n\nAfter the formal meeting had broken up, one woman came up to him\nprivately and said, \"You were talking about the Holocaust, weren't\nyou?\" He answered, \"If that is an example that came to your mind,\nthen you are right, I was talking about it to you. But I would not\ntalk about it to everyone, for not everyone can bear it.\" I assume\nthat he meant that, without the Holocaust, there would have been no\nstate of Israel.\n\nSomeone hearing the rabbi's lecture might leap to the conclusion\nthat God is dependent on the wickedness of men to accomplish His\npurposes -- or at least that the rabbi thought so. He might then  go\non to suppose that the wickedness is in fact God's doing -- that He\nstirred up Joseph's brothers to a murderous hate against him, and\nthat when the Israelites were in Egypt, God hardened Pharaoh's\nheart, so that he oppressed the people, and would not let them go.\nAnd this raises questions about how an action can be considered\nwicked and at the same time be considered something that God has\nbrought about.\n\nI suggest another way of looking at it. Consider a sculptor who has\na log of wood from which he proposes to carve a statue. But the log,\ninstead of having a smooth even grain throughout, has a large knot\nthat spoils the appearance of the surface. The sculptor considers\nthe wood for a while, and then carves a statue that features the\nknot, that makes that particular interruption in the grain and color\nof the wood correspond to some feature of the statue, so that\nobservers will say: \"How fortunate the sculptor was in finding a\npiece of wood with a knot like that in just the right place. Its\npresence is the crowning touch, the thing that makes the statue a\ngreat work of art.\" In reality, the knot, far from being what the sculptor was\nlooking for, was a challenge to his skill. If the wood had not\ncontained that flaw, he would still have made a great work of art,\nbut a different one. So, if Joseph's brothers had not sold him, God\nwould still have brought about His purposes for the Jewish people,\nbut He would have done so in another manner. If Judas had not\nbetrayed Jesus, if Caiaphas and his fellow leaders had not rejected\nJesus, but had rather acknowledged Him as the Annointed of God, if\nPilate had followed his conscience rather than his fears and had set\nJesus free, it might appear that there would have been no\nCrucifixion, and therefore no Redemption, and therefore no\nSalvation. Not so. God did not need Judas' sin to redeem us. If\nJudas had done right, then God in Christ would still have reconciled\nthe world to Himself.  We do not know how, just as we do not know\nhow Michelangelo would have painted the Sistine Chapel if its\ninterior had instead been shaped like Grand Central Station, and\njust as we do not know how Bobby Fisher would have won his fourth\ngame agianst Spassky if Spassky had refused the exchange of bishops\nand had attacked Fisher's knight instead (don't bother to look up\nthe game in question--I am making up this example, but the point is\nnone the less valid).\n\nThus, we may say both (1) that God used, say, the cowardice of\nPilate to accomplish His purposes, and (2) that the said cowardice\nwas not God's doing, and that Pilate would not have thwarted God's\nplans by behaving justly and courageously.\n\nWhat, then, are we to make of the place where God says to Moses, \"I\nwill harden Pharaoh's heart, so that he will not let the people go\"?\nSome Christians have taken this to mean that Pharaoh was a puppet\nwith God pulling the strings, and that his stubbornness and cruelty\nwere not his own work, but the work of God in him. I suppose rather\nthat what God was telling Moses was something like this: \"If you see\nthat Pharaoh is not willing to let the people go, do not be\ndiscouraged, or suppose that the situation is out of my control. My\npurposes will not be thwarted. If Pharaoh chooses to hear you and\nlet the people go, well and good. If he does not, I will fit his\nresistance into my plans, and fit it so perfectly that future\nhistorians and theologians will suppose that I would have been\nthrown for a loss if Pharaoh had obeyed me.\"\n\nTo return to the question that started this all off. Is it possible\nthat the Serbs, in slaughtering the Moslems of Bosnia, are\ninstruments of God's will?\n     First point. What they are doing is wrong, just as what\nJoseph's brothers did was wrong, just as what Judas did was wrong.\nThey intend it for evil. If God somehow brings good out of it, that\ndoes not make them any less subject to just condemnation and\npunishment.\n     Second point. Of course, God will bring good out of it. But not\nthe same good that He would have brought if the Serbians had\nrefrained from the sins of robbery and rape and murder. Nor does the\ngood He purposes excuse us from the duty of doing what is right.\n\n Yours,\n James Kiefer",

As for\nthe Codexes you mention, both Vaticanus and Sinaitcus include the\nDeuterocanon, bothe of the New and Old Testaments, and Vaticanus (I\nthink) inlcudes 1 Clement, the Shepard of Hermas, and the Epistle of\nBaranabas.

(If all else fails :-)\n>Show me where I'm wrong.\n\n\tYou're not wrong!  It is a `tradition of men' to exlcude them, as I\nwill explain below.\n\n\"That nothing be read in the Church under the nmae of Divine Scripture,\nexcept the canonical Scriptures, and the canoncial Scriptures are -\nGenesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, Deuteronomy, Joshua, Judges, Ruth,\nFour books of Kingdoms [being 1&2 Samuel and 1&2 Kings], Two books of\nParalpomenon [being 1&2 Chronicles], Job, the Psalter of David, the Five\nbooks of Solomon [being Proverbs, Ecclesiastes, Song of Songs, Wisdom of\nSolomon, and [misatributed to him] the Wisdom of Jesus son of Sirach],\nThe books of the Twelve (Minor) Prophets, Isaiah, Jeremiah [being\nJeremiah, the Lamentations, Baruch, and the Letter, all of which were\nformerly counted as one], Ezekiel, Daniel, Tobit, Judith, Esther, Two\nbooks of Ezra [being Ezra and Nehemiah], Two books of Maccabees.  And of\nthe New Testament: Four books of the Gospel, One book of the Acts of the\nApostles, Thirteen letters of Paul the Apostle, One Letter of the same\nto the Hebrews, two of Peter the Apostle, Three of John, One of the\nApostle Jude, One of the Apostle James, One book of the Apocalypse of\nJohn.\"\n\t-Council of Hippo, Statute 36, (393 AD)\n\n\tThis same list was promulgated again at the Third Council of Carthage\n(397 AD), and at the Sixth Council of Carthage (419 AD) - at which\ncouncil the same list was enumerated with the words \"Because we have\nrecieved from the Fathers that these are the books to be read in the\nChurch.\"  Which ought to quiet those who assert \"in the name of Holy\nScripture we do understand those books of whose authority there was\nnever any doubt in the Church,\" as the Episcopal Church does in removing\nthe Deuterocanon from the realm of Scripture.  (Though the Episcopalians\nhold them in high regard and read them in the Church, they are not\ncounted as Scripture by them, and may not be used to prove dogma.  The\nLutherans hold out similarly.)\n\tEarlier mention of the so-called Apocrypha as divine scripture can also\nbe found, and below I inlcude only a portion of the quotes calling it\ndivine scripture that could be found among the writings of the Fathers.\n\n\"And this is the reason why the Law of the old Testament is reckoned as\nconsisting of twenty-two books: so that they may correspond to the\nnumber of letters [in the Hebrew alphabet].... It is to be noted also\nthat by adding to these Tobias and Judith, there are twenty-four books,\ncorresponding to the number of letters used by the Greeks.\"\n\t-St. Hillary of Poitiers, \"Commentaries on the Psalms,\" prologue, 15 (365 AD)\n\n\"The twenty-two books according to the Hebrews are .... Jeremiah, with\nLamentations and the Letter, reckoned as one .... and [also] there is\nMaccabees.\"\n\t-Origen, \"Commentaries on the Psalms,\" Psalm 1 (245 AD)\n\n\"Divine Scripture, addressing itself to those who love themselves and to\nthe boastful .... says most excellently [Baruch 3.16-19 follows].\"\n\t-St. Clement of Alexandria, \"The Instuctor of Children,\" 2, 3, 36, 3, (203 AD)\n\n\"....I learned accurately the books of the Old Testament ... Proverbs of\nSolomon, and also Wisdom ...\"\n\t-St. Melito of Sardes, fragment found in Eusebius' \"History of the\nChurch,\" and dating from crica 177 AD, Book 4, 26, 14\n\n\"It is likewise decreed: Now, indeed, we must treat of the divine\nScriptures: what the universal Catholic Church accepts and what she must\nshun.  The list of the Old Testament .... Wisdom, one book;\nEcclesiasticus, one book .... Tobit, one book .... Judith, one book; of\nMaccabees, two books.\"\n\t-St. Damasus I, Pope, \"The Decree of Damsus,\" section 2 (382 AD)\n\n\tI would think this enough, though more can be shown, that the Church\nhas always accepted the deutero-canon, though parts have been disputed\nby various persons.  For if disputes involving the New Testament\ndeutero-canon does not disqulaify those books (i.e. Hebrews, James, 2\nPeter, 2&3 John, Jude, Revelation) in Protestant eyes, than neither\nshould it disqulaify the Old Testament books.  And I must point out that\nthe Jews only drew up their canon in 90 AD, 60 years after the founding\nof the Christian Religion upon the Cross.  Why should we adhere to a\ncanon that was drawn up by the faithless, in reaction to the Chrsitian\nuse of the Greek Septuagint, which includes the deutero-canon?  As early\nas 150 AD, St. Justin had already accused the Jews of mutilating the\nCanon of Scripture by their removal of certain books.  Protestants\napparently prefer to think that God's revelation was limited by a decree\nof the Jews in the ordering of their (the Jews') faithless canon, and\nthat he could not use other people, like the Apostles, in drawing up the\ncanon.  The Apostles were most certain users of the Septuagint, as some\n80% of the Old Testament quotes use the wording of the Septuagint, and\nnot the Hebrew.  And the Septuagint includes the Deuterocanon.",

Worse still; have I expressed \njudgement and disgust at their doings, and thus alienated them from any \npositive relationship whereby I might pass along anything positive?  \nI _know_ I've got something to repent about on that score.\n\nAnyway, it's a real interesting question.  \n--\npaul marxhausen .... ....... ............. ............ ............ .......... \n .. . .  . . . university of nebraska - lincoln .  . . .. . .  .. . . . . . . .\n .     .    .  .   .     .   .  .    .   .  .   .    .   .  grace .   .    .  . \n   .         .       .      .        .        .      .        .   happens .",

    "Text": "From: JJMARVIN@pucc.princeton.edu\nSubject: prayers and advice requested on family problem\nOrganization: Princeton University\nLines: 70\n\nMy brother has been alienated from my parents and me since shortly after\nhis marriage to a domineering and insecure woman, about twelve years ago.\nWe've kept things on a painfully polite, Christmas-card sort of level\nfor most of this time. Attempts to see each other end disastrously, with\nhis wife throwing a screaming fit and storming out over either our imagined\nslights to her, or his inattention or insensitivity to her (I mean, this'll\nhappen by the end of a single restaurant meal). He seems, from what I've\nseen, to live in a state of quivering anxiety, hoping futilely to keep\nthe next storm from breaking. He has sacrificed not only meaningful contact\nwith us but also other friends and outside interests. Now, this is his\nchoice, and I need to accept it even if I deplore it. But it's hard.\n   From time to time I've wanted to drop the pretense that we have a\nrelationship--by cutting off contact--or trying to have a real if painful\nrelationship, by talking honestly with him, but I've always thought, \"Why\nbe dramatic? And you know he'll only get evasive and then find some excuse\nto get off the phone. Just leave the door open, in case he ever decides to\ncome back.\" It's been an unsatisfying choice, to allow us to go on\nwith the superficial trappings of a relationship, but it was the best I\ncould think of.\n   Now, this weekend, my mother finally decided that she wasn't going\nto pretend any more and has cut off relations with them. This was the\noutcome of a phone conversation in which my sister-in-law screamed and\nraved at my mother, blaming her for everything wrong in their lives, and\nin which my brother evaded, temporized, claimed the situation was\nbeyond his control, and as always expected my mother to make all the\nallowances and concessions. Mom said she would not, that she would not\nquietly take abuse any more, and that if these were the terms of their\nrelationship, she didn't want to talk to or see them any more. And she hung\nup. (I have never seem my mother lose her temper, and I think that this is\nthe first time she's ever hung up on someone.) Mom says she feels as if\nshe's divorced my brother, and that it's a relief in some ways to have the\nbreak out in the open and done with.\n \n    I have mixed feelings. I'm proud of Mom for sticking up for herself;\nangry at my brother and sister-in-law for hurting her, for being jerks, for\npersisting in such a wretched life, which hurts us all and is warping their\nchildren; angry at my sister-in-law for being so hateful, and angry at my\nbrother for being a coward and having so little respect for himself or us\nthat he's willing to throw us aside and use up all his energy trying to\nappease an unappeasable,\nemotionally disturbed woman; pained for their children, who are a mess;\nscared for the future, since this marks the time when either things will\nchange and improve or the break will become irrevocable; nastily self-\nrighteous over this bit of proof that they can't \"get away\" with treating\nus or each other this way, and then disgusted with myself for even\nbeginning to gloat over others' misery; and finally, mostly, sad, sad,\nsad, to see my parents hurt and my brother and sister-in-law trapped in\na horrible, destructive situation that they can't see a way out of--or\nthey can't bear to take whatever paths they do see. And I'm frustrated\nbecause I don't know what if anything to do, and doing nothing drives me\nup the wall. I try to pray, about my own feelings of rage, impotence,\nand vindictiveness, and about their situation, but I am not\nfree of the desire to *DO* something concrete. (The desire to *DO*\nsomething, to define a problem and fix it, is one of my besetting\nvices; I'm having a terrible time quieting down my internal\nmental chatter enough to listen for God.)\n  Do you thoughtful and kind people on the net have advice for me? Is\nthis a time to reach out to my brother? To let things be? How can I\nconquer my rage AT him enough to be there FOR him?\n \nHere's the big question I've been evading throughout this long, long\npost: Is it ok, as a Christian and a proponent of faith, hope, and\ncharity, to accept the destruction of a relationship? To give up on\nmy own brother, or at least to accept that I am powerless to help him\nand can only wait and see what happens? Do please answer--by e-mail or\npost.\n \nThank you.\n \nJulie (jjmarvin@pucc.princeton.edu)",

    "Text": "From: muirm@argon.gas.organpipe.uug.arizona.edu (maxwell c muir)\nSubject: Re: Homosexuality issues in Christianity\nOrganization: University of Arizona, Tucson\nLines: 75\n\nCan someone cite Biblical references to homosexuality being immoral, other\nthan Leviticus? So far, when I ask, around here, I get the verses from\nLeviticus spouted at me, but the whole rest of that book tends to be\nignored by Christians (haven't seen any stonings in a _long_ time :-).\n\nLater,\nMax (Bob) Muir\n\n[The list was posted not long ago, as I recall, aside from Lev, commonly\ncited passages are:\n\nthe story of Sodom.  Note however that this was a homosexual rape, and\nthere's no disagreement that that is wrong.  I take an intermediate\nposition on this: note that Sodom is referred to elsewhere in the\nBible for its sinfulness.  It doesn't seem to have been known\nspecifically for homosexuality.  Rather, I think it was considered a\ncesspool of all sins. However from what we know of Jewish attitudes,\nhomosexuality would have contributed to the horror of the action\ndescribed.  (It almost seems to have been contrived to combine about\nas many forms of evil in one act as possible: homosexual rape of\nguests, who were actually angels.)  But this story is not specifically\nabout homosexuality.\n\nIn the NT, the clear references are all from Paul's letters.  In Rom\n1, there is a passage that presupposes that homosexuality is an evil.\nNote that the passage isn't about homosexuality -- it's about\nidolatry.  Homosexuality is visited on people as a punishment, or at\nleast result, of idolatry.  There are a number of arguments over this\npassage.  It does not use the word \"homosexuality\", and it is referring\nto people who are by nature heterosexual practicing homosexuality.\nSo it's not what I'd call an explicit teaching against all homosexuality.\nBut it does seem to support what would be a natural assumption anyway,\nthat Paul shares the general negative Jewish attitude towards \nhomosexuality.\n\nThe other passages occur in lists of sins, in I Cor 6:9, and I Tim\n1:10.  Unfortunately it's not entirely clear what the words used here\nmean.  There have been suggestions that one has a broader meaning,\nsuch as \"wanton\", and that another may be specifically \"male\nprostitute\".  Again, we don't have here a precise teaching about\nhomosexuality, but it is at least weak supportive evidence that Paul\nshared the OT's negative judgement on homosexuality.\n\nJude 1:7 is sometimes cited, however it's probably not relevant.  The\ncontext in Jude involves angels.  Since those who were almost raped in\nSodom were angels, it seems likely that \"strange flesh\" refers to\nintercourse with angels.\n\nAs you can see, the NT evidence is such that people's conclusion is\ndetermined by their approach to the Bible.  Conservatives note that\nthe passages from Paul's letters imply that he accepted the OT\nprohibition.  This is enough for them to regard it as having NT\nendorsement.  Liberals note that there's no specific teaching, and no\nclear definition of what is being prohibited or why (is the concern in\nRom 1 the connection of homosexuality to pagan worship?  what exactly\ndo the words in the lists of sins mean?).  Thus some believe it is\nlegitimate to regard this as a attitude Paul took with him from his\nbackground and not a specific teaching of the Gospel.\n\nThis is an explosive topic, which tends to result in long\ndissertations on the exact meaning of various Greek words.  But it's\nclear to me that that's mostly irrelevant.  What it really comes down\nto is whether people are looking to the Bible for law or whether they\nbelieve that such as approach is inconsistent with the Gospel.  This\nappears to depend upon one's reaction to the message of the Bible as a\nwhole, as well as one's perception of the needs of the church today.\nThis is a difference of approach at least as serious as the difference\nbetween Protestant and Catholic in the 16th Cent, and one where both\nsides believe that the Bible is so obviously on their side that they\nkeep thinking all they have to do is quote a few more passages and the\nother side will finally come to their senses.  That makes things\nvery frustrating for a moderator, who realizes that such an optimistic\noutcome is not very likely...\n\n--clh]",

Before you post a text in reply investigate its context.\n\nFirst of all, \"ceremonial law\" is an extraScriptural term.  It is sometimes\nused as a framework to view Scripture.  But if you look at Collosions,\nwithout going into it with the assumption that the Sabbath cannot be \na ceremonial law, you will see that it does refer to the sabbath.\n\nPaul writes in Collosions 2:14-17 how that Christ nailed the laws that were\nagainst us to His cross, and therefore we should not be judged in what\nwhat food we eat, what we drink, the keeping of new moons and holy days,\nor the keeping of the sabbath.\n\nThe word for sabbath in this verse is \"sabbaton\" and is used throughout the\nNew Testament to refer to the 7th day.  If there is any Scripture from\nwhich we get the idea of the ceremonial law, this is one of them, and the\nsabbath is listed among the ceremonial laws.\n\nIf one goes into this with the fundamental assumption \"the sabbath cannot\nbe a ceremonial law\" then he will have to find some way around it, like\nsaying that this can only refer to the other sabbath holy days besides the\n7tH day, Because \"the sabbath cannot be a ceremonial law.\"  But\nPaul is very careful in his letters to add some kind of parenthetcal \nstatement if there is anything that can be seen as a liscence to sin\nin his writings.\n\nAlso, why is the sabbath absent from the epistles (except for Hebrews 4, which\ntalks about the rest that comes through faith?)  Surely it would have\nbeen a big problem for first century Christians living in a society\nthat did not rest on the 7th day.  Especially slaves. Many new converst were\nslaves.

In other words, you can only be sure\nthat your conscience is `properly formed' if you assume that your evaluation\ncan be trusted.  Assuming your conclusions saves you a lot of time, I'll\ngrant, but it's not a valid way of reasoning.\n\nUnless you are infallible, your judgements about your own thinking cannot be\ncertain.  Therefore, it is not possible to be certain your conscience is\n`properly formed'.

Saying you are absolutely certain is\nsignificantly different than saying you are confident.  When you say that\nyou are confident, that invites people to ask why.\n\nExcept in very limited circumstances, when you say that you are absolutely\ncertain, it invites people to dismiss you as someone who does not have any\nidea of his own fallibility.\n\n\nI have yet to meet anyone who believed in a knowably-infallible source of\ntruth who would admit the possibility of errors in his reasoning.

I read EVERY letter and thought about \neach one!! \n\nI got all sorts of responses, from \"marry her\" to \"have nothing ever to \ndo with her again\"\n\nThrough reading the Bible and through a lot of prayer, here is what I have\ndecided to do.\n\nI sent her a letter today. First, i told her that if she was really serious\nabout moving away from home to another state that \"I would do anything to \nget you here in NC.\" I told her that I tried to find out if there were \nany new stores planning to be built---but they wouldn't tell me.\n\nAbout her marraige comment (I'm not gonna call it a proposal, cause\nI still don't know if it was a total joke or not) I more or less said\nthat \"Marry me?? Well, get transferred to NC first and then we'll talk :) :)\"\n\nHopefully, what i said could be interpreted either way.\n\nNeedless to say, there has been a lot of praying over this...I \nhave done a lot of reading about marraige from the Bible. If\nshe was dead serious about getting married---I wouldn't do it\nyet simply b/c she is not (as far as I know to this point) a Christian.\nIt just wouldn't work w/o God in the marraige as well. I figure\nthat if God wanrs this to go through--he's kept us in touch for 10 \nyears now---he can handle one more. If God wants it to happen, it\nwill happen!\n\nShe will be in NC in June meetinf some relatives so I'll get to \nsee her...and I'll get a letter from her befoe then so I know\nmore of what to look forward to.\n\nI guess all I can do now is wait and pray. I have decided not to tell\nmy folks until I'm totally sure what is going on.\n\nI do ask that everyone that wrote me to please keep this situation\nin your prayers..\n\nFinally, I would like to thank EVERYONE who wrote in...\n\nIf you have anything else for me...I will be at this email address\nfor one week. Please tell me anyhting you want...I'm curious\nhow folks think about what i did.\n\n\nThanx\n\nChris",

An atheist is one for whom all things can\nbe understood as processes of nature - exclusively. There is no need\nfor any recourse to Divnity to describe or explain anything. There is\nno purpose or direction for any event beyond those required by\nphysics, chemistry, biology, etc.; everything is random, nothing is\ndetermnined.\nThis would also have to include human intelligence of course and all\nits products. There is nothing requiring that life evolve or that it\nacquire intelligence, it's just a happy accident. For an atheist, no\nevent can be preferred to another or be said to have more or less\nvalue than another in any naturalistic sense, and no thought -about-\nan event can have value. \nThe products of our intelligence are acquired from our environment,\nfrom teaching, training, observation and experience and are only\nsignificant to the individual mind wherein they reside. These mental\nprocesses and the images they produce for us are just electrical\nactivity and nothing more; content is of no consequence. The human\nmind is as much a response to natural forces as water running down a\nhill.\nHow then can an atheist judge value? What is the basis for criticizing\nthe values ennumerated in the Bible or the purposes imputed to God? On\nwhat grounds can the the behavior of the reliogious be condemned? It\nseems that, in judging the values that motivate others to action, you\nhave to have some standard against which conduct is measured, but what\nin nature can serve that purpose? What law of nature can you invoke to\nestablish your values.\nSince every event is entirely and exclusively a physical event, what\ndifference could it possibly make what -anyone- does, religious or\notherwise, there can be no -meaning- or gradation of value. The only\nway an atheist can object to -any- behaviour is to admit that the\nobjection is entirely subjective and that he(she) just doesn't like it\n- that's it. Any value judgement must be prefaced by the disclaimer\nthat it is nothing more than a matter of personal opinion and carries\nno weight in any \"absolute\" sense.\nThat you don't like what God told people to do says nothing about God\nor God's commands, it says only that there was an electrical event in your\nnervous system that created an emotional state that your mind coupled\nwith a pre-existing thought-set to form that reaction. That your\nobjections -seem- well founded is due to the way you've been\nconditioned; there is no \"truth\" content. The whole of your\nintellectual landscape is an illusion, a virtual reality.\nI didn't make these rules, it's inherent in naturalistic atheism and\nto be consistent, you have to accept the non-significance of any human\nthought, even your own. All of this being so, you have excluded\nyourself from any discussion of values, right, wrong, goood, evil,\netc. and cannot participate. Your opinion about the Bible can have no\nweight whatsoever.\n\nBill",

The Assumption of our\nBlessed Mother, meant that because of her close identification with the\nredemptive work of Christ, she was Assumed (note that she did not\nASCEND) body and soul into Heaven, and is thus one of the few, along\nwith Elijah, Enoch, Moses (maybe????) who are already perfected in\nHeaven.  Obviously, the Virgin Mary is far superior in glorification to\nany of the previously mentioned personages.\n\nJung should stick to Psychology rather than getting into Theology.\n\nAndy Byler",
